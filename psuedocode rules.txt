rules of psuedocode

psuedocode at least as defined in the video series doesn't have any defined rules
I mean I'll go ahead and write some that I figure seem to be common rules but he pretty explicitly said that any rules that are defined for psuedocode are just the rules of whoever is doing that model of psuedocode

make it easy to understand
write in natural language
has to have a start and an end
indented as if it was a real program
match variable case

I don't know the last one I'm just kinda pulling from thin air here.
